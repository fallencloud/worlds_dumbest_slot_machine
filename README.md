# The World's Dumbest Slot Machine

My solution to one of the exercises from Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp on Udemy

## Assignment

1. There should be three machine components
2. Each component should take three props
3. The component should print the props
4. If the props match, print "You win"
5. Otherwise, print "You Lose"

I changed the assignment a bit by having each component randomly generate their results.
